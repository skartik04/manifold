Emma Reed's Monday morning lasted exactly nine minutes before it imploded.
At 9:09 a.m., halfway through her first virtual presentation at her new job, a thunderous clang shattered through her ceiling — followed by a metallic crash and a very human, "Oh crap!"
Her laptop screen froze. Coffee splattered across her spreadsheet. The ceiling above her dining table now had a neat, circular dent — as if God Himself had decided to play drums.
Emma blinked once, twice, then said very calmly, "I'll be right back," into the stunned silence of the Zoom call.
By 9:10, she was stomping up the old wooden stairs to Apartment 3B — still barefoot, coffee dripping down her wrist, righteous fury building with every step. She didn't know who lived up there, but whoever they were had just declared war.
The door opened to reveal a tall, unshaven man in a faded band tee, holding a cracked cymbal like a wounded animal. Behind him, cables, amps, and empty coffee cups spilled across the room like modern art.
"Uh… hi," he said. "Funny story—" "Not really," Emma snapped. "You nearly gave my boss a heart attack. What are you even doing up here?"
He grinned — the kind of grin that suggested this wasn't his first apology of the week.
"Technically? Sound design. Emotionally? Regretting it."
Emma stared at him. Portland, she realized, had lied to her. The apartment ad had said 'quiet building.' Emma folded her arms, eyeing the chaos behind him — guitars on the couch, ramen cups stacked like trophies, a cat sleeping inside a snare drum.
"This is not quiet," she said. "You realize you dropped an entire cymbal through my ceiling?"
Jack glanced upward, as if the damage might somehow look less catastrophic from his side.
"Technically it bounced off the ceiling," he said. "Gravity did most of the work."
Emma blinked. "You're blaming physics?" "I'm giving physics the credit it deserves." He tried a smile that could've passed for charming if it weren't paired with bed hair and a bruise on his forearm. "Look, I'm sorry. I was setting up a mic rig for a podcast thing, and—"
"A podcast thing?" she interrupted. "You run a podcast up here?"
"Kind of. Sort of. Occasionally. It's... evolving." "Into what? A demolition company?" That got the laugh he was clearly waiting for. He leaned against the doorframe, easy and unbothered. "You're new here, huh? No one else gets this upset anymore."
"Maybe because you've already driven everyone else insane."
At that, his grin softened. "You might be right." They stood there for a moment — her clutching her mug, him balancing the dented cymbal between his hands, the faint hum of rain filtering through the hallway window.
"Okay," she said finally, exhaling. "Just… please keep it down. I actually need this job."
"Deal," he said immediately. "And, uh, sorry about your ceiling. I'll fix it."
"You'll fix it? "Yeah," he said, as though this were a reasonable offer from a man surrounded by duct-taped amplifiers. "How hard could it be?"
Two hours later, Emma was back in her apartment staring up at a square of mismatched plaster and painter's tape that looked suspiciously like the surface of the moon.
Jack had waved at her through the hole before patching it up — cheerfully, like this was all some sitcom cold open.
It wasn't until that evening, when she heard faint music drifting through the floor — soft, careful guitar chords, nothing like the chaos from earlier — that she stopped mid-email and actually listened.
The song was slow, almost hesitant. And though she'd never admit it, Emma caught herself tapping her pencil in time.
Maybe, she thought, just maybe, her new neighbor wasn't completely unbearable. By Thursday, Emma had convinced herself the whole cymbal fiasco was behind her.
The ceiling was patched (mostly), her Zoom meetings were peaceful again, and she had started using noise-canceling headphones — a modern miracle she now considered an emotional support device.
Everything was back to normal.
Until 7:43 a.m.
That's when she stepped into the lobby and found Jack Wilder halfway up a stepladder, shirt untucked, taping a handwritten flyer to the building's corkboard. His coffee mug sat precariously on the top step, a doomed soldier waiting to fall.
The flyer read:
COMMUNITY CREATIVE GRANT: $2,500 FOR LOCAL PROJECTS!
Need team members. Music side covered — looking for literally anyone organized.
Emma stopped. "Organized?" she said.
Jack turned, nearly losing his balance. "Hey, Cymbal Girl!"
"Don't call me that."
"Still better than 'Spreadsheet Lady,'" he said. Then, seeing her raised eyebrow: "Okay, fair. What's up?"
"I was just wondering who in their right mind would volunteer to work with someone who drops percussion instruments through ceilings."
Jack pointed to the flyer. "Someone who wants half the grant money, maybe? You seem the type who likes things to add up."
"I have a job."
"So do I," he said. "Well… technically. Freelance sound design, short-term contracts, side projects, tax chaos — the dream."
She snorted before she could stop herself. "You really think the city's going to give you money for whatever this is?"
"Sure," he said. "But only if I find someone who knows, you know, how to apply for it."
He smiled that same infuriating, magnetic grin.
"Emma Reed," she said finally, taking the pen from his pocket and correcting a misspelled word on his flyer. "If you're going to put something on a public board, at least spell 'initiative' correctly."
Jack looked at the correction, then at her. "So you are applying."
"I am not."
"Sounds like a yes."
"I said—"
Just then, the retired mailman from 1A shuffled by with his morning crossword and muttered, "You two fight like an old married couple."
Emma froze. Jack grinned wider.
When she got to the sidewalk, heart annoyingly fast, she realized she was still holding his pen.
And the part that bothered her most wasn't that she'd forgotten to give it back.
It was that she was already wondering what kind of project he had in mind.
By the weekend, Emma had almost forgotten about the flyer — or at least, she'd convinced herself she had. Then a knock came at her door Saturday morning, right as she was halfway through reorganizing her spice rack alphabetically.
She opened it to find Jack standing there, holding two lattes and wearing that same disarming grin.
"Truce coffee," he said, holding one out like a peace offering. "Oat milk, one sugar. I asked around."
"You asked around?"
"Pam in 2C knows everything about everyone."
Emma sighed but took the coffee. "You realize this doesn't erase property damage."
"I'm banking on caffeine-based forgiveness," Jack said. Then he nodded toward the hallway. "Can I show you something?"
Before she could protest, he was already leading her to the building's tiny community room — the one usually used for book clubs and awkward potlucks. The space was now covered in sketches, sticky notes, and half-taped posters.
"I've been thinking about the grant," he said, pacing. "Something that helps the neighborhood and keeps this building from falling apart."
Emma frowned. "You're serious about applying?"
"Dead serious." He pointed to a messy drawing on the wall labeled 'The Building Sessions.'
"It's a series. Residents share stories, I record and score them. A kind of audio time capsule — our voices, our noise, our weirdness."
She looked at the poster again. It was chaotic, but there was something oddly beautiful about it.
"So… a documentary podcast?"
"More like an emotional one," he said. "The sound of this place. I just— I don't know how to write the proposal part. Or handle the budget. Or, you know, deadlines."
"Shocking," she said dryly.
He grinned. "That's where you come in."
Emma hesitated. Her brain immediately started cataloguing problems: time, logistics, possible failure. But behind all that was a small, inconvenient spark of curiosity.
"What makes you think I'd agree to this?"
"Because," Jack said, "I've heard you humming in your kitchen every night. You're not as boring as you pretend to be."
Her mouth opened — no sound came out.
He stepped closer, lowering his voice. "One month. We win the grant, the building gets a real project, you get full control of the plan. I'll follow your lead."
Emma stared at him, trying to decide if this was reckless or exactly what she needed.
Finally, she said, "You'll follow my lead?"
"Completely."
"Then rule number one," she said, taking his marker and rewriting his heading in clean, perfect block letters:
'The Building Sessions: A Community Storytelling Project.'
Jack smiled. "I like it. Sounds official."
"Sounds organized," she corrected.
And that was how it started — not with romance, not with fate, just with a grant application, two coffees, and a musician who refused to take no for an answer.
But as Emma would soon find out, the line between organized and attached could blur faster than a snare hit.
